# Hello World

This example converts a bitmap font to SNES tiles to print an "Hello World".

It shows how palette and tiles can be extracted from a PNG image and used in a SNES Rom for graphics.

Use `make` to compile and run `Hello.smc` with your favorite SNES emulator. It has been tested in ZSNES and Higan.
